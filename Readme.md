Q3)The code for question 3 has been changes since its last implementation. I added a new function "fill_half_empty" . Since i was getting a complexity of c for the
funtion "fill_empty".Now both my functions have a complexity of B and the overall code has a complexity of A.Instead of filling all time pairs in one function I broke it up into 2 parts . First function (fill_empty) only checks if time slot between 9am and employees starting time are same (and same for last time slot and 5pm) and adds it to free time if not the same . Second function(fill_half_empty) fills in all the other time slots of the remaining day.
